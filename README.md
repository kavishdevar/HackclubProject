# Boozer (my scrapyard project with @bunchofcells)

You, an avrage high schooler, chilling around watching youtube when you were supposed to be studying, unaware of your mom secretly about to enter your room. But behold! As soon as she enters, the sensor detects your mom and starts playing cat sounds, so you know your mom is here! In order to stop the cat sounds, your mom must play a game of wordle, in order to stop the sounds. Every wrong attempt, and the buzzer buzzes louder and louder, giving your mom a lesson to not come in your room again.
